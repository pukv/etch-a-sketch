# etch-a-sketch

- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript
- Create a hover effect when mouse passes over the divs
- Add a button on top of the screen that will ask for the number of squares per side for the new grid
- Once entered, the old grid should be removed
- It should run when the button is clicked

Extra credit

- make random RGB color instead of black when mouse passes over the divs
- make the divs progressively darker once mouse passes over them
